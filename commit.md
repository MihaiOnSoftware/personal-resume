### Commit Message Rules
- Only mention things that are different from the last commit
- Do not mention intermediary steps or changes that were added and then removed within the same commit session
- Focus on the final state, not the process of getting there
- Append `-- claude-4-sonnet supported` to the commit message if the commit was made using Claude 4 Sonnet (modify for other models)
- Keep explanation of what was done short, quick, and direct
- Only add additional context beyond the first line if explaining why or if something is not easily inferred from the code
