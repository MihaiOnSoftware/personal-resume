          </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="sub-section">
          <p class="mono">
            I am an experienced software developer and engineering manager that has worked in a variety of software
            organizations ranging from start-ups to large, cross-functional enterprises. From a technical perspective
            this includes extensive experience with Ruby on Rails, AWS, and React systems. From a more human oriented
            view I excel at establishing high-performing teams that I care deeply about. I am passionate about the work
            that I produce, which has allowed me to develop a strong work ethic and instilled in me a willingness to
            always improve. This, combined with my varied areas of expertise, diligence, and thorough approach, allow
            me to consistently exceed expectations.
            <br /><br />
            I strive to build resilient and high-performing teams, both as a manager and an individual contributor.
            Change is constant and only teams that can be agile and adaptive are successful. I'm a strong believer in
            continuous improvement for myself and my teams so we can execute with grace and agility.
            <br /><br />
            Some of my most notable achievements include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li type="square" class="mono">
              Significantly improving the performance and reliability of
              Nulogy's flagship product.
            </li>
            <li type="square" class="mono">
              Building and managing two key teams at Nulogy through the
              pandemic, remote transition, and recession.
            </li>
            <li type="square" class="mono">
              Rolling out two completely new products while maintaining
              existing critical systems, all while dealing with the unique
              challenges of remote work.
            </li>
            <li type="square" class="mono">
              Introducing a culture of pair programming at Shopify and
              building a pair programming workshop to onboard new developers.
            </li>
            <li type="square" class="mono">
              Being an early adopter of AI tools at Nulogy and helping to build
              a body of knowledge on how to use them effectively.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="trebut section-title dark-green">But why did you switch back to development?</h2>
          <p class="mono">
            While management was definitely the challenge that I needed, there
            were still so many opportunities to stretch in an individual
            contributor role. My wide breadth of skills and willingness to
            dive into unknown waters made me a perfect fit for a team that
            does precisely that. Plus I just love coding and missed it dearly!
