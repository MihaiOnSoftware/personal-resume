          Before I tell you about myself, why don't you take a look at my new
          chatbot, it can be found in the bottom right corner of this (and every
          other) page. Feel free to ask it anything you want to know about me,
          it has access to the same information as this website and more!
        </b>
        <p class="mono">
          Hi, I'm Mihai, a software developer with experience in a wide range
          of areas. I'm passionate about creating solutions that solve real
          problems in elegant ways, both on a technical and user experience
          level. I care deeply about collaboration, teams, quality, and
          personal/team growth.
        </p>
        <p class="mono">
          For modern software systems to thrive, growth and agility must be
          baked into them. As such, work needs to be optimized for flow
          efficiency and feedback loops. I'm always searching for ways to grow
          personally, my team, and our practices in order to best build and
          maintain such systems.
        </p>
        <p class="mono">
          I strive to be as honest and straightforward as possible
          while leveraging my compassion and empathy for others. Feedback is
          something that's welcome with me.
        </p>
        <p class="mono">
          On a personal level: I'm a father, a partner, often a friend, a
          gamer, a D&D DM, and many other things! I like to read ridiculous
          amounts of sci-fi and fantasy novels (I have over 900 books marked
          as read on my Goodreads account, those are just the ones I remember
          reading), I play (mediocre) guitar, and am terrible at anything else
          requiring manual dexterity.
        </p>
        <p class="mono">
          This site is perpetually under construction as I'm constantly
          improving on it. If you're looking for something more index optimized,
          check out my <a href="resume.html" class="green">resume</a>. If you have
          any feedback for me about the current state of things please visit my
          <a href="contact.html" class="green">contact</a> page and let me know.
        </p>
        <p class="mono">
          Thank you for coming by to visit,
          <br />
          Mihai
