            Hi, I'm Mihai, a software developer with experience in a wide range
            of areas. I'm passionate about creating solutions that solve real
            problems in elegant ways, both on a technical and user experience
            level. I care deeply about collaboration, teams, quality, and
            personal/team growth.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            Many of the software systems being produced today are E-type
            (embedded), this means that they are not only affected by their
            environment, but in turn affect that environment. For such systems
            to thrive, growth and agility must be baked into them. As such, work
            needs to be optimized for flow efficiency and feedback loops. I'm
            always searching for ways to grow personally, my team, and our
            practices in order to best build and maintain such systems.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            I strive to always be as honest and straightforward as possible
            while leveraging my compassion and empathy for others. Feedback is
            always something that's welcome with me! I am still learning all the
            time so I'm always looking to improve.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            On a personal level: I'm a Father, a partner, often a friend, a
            gamer, a D&D DM, and many other things! I like to read ridiculous
            amounts of sci-fi and fantasy novels (I have over 900 books marked
            as read on my Goodreads account, those are just the ones I remember
            reading), I play (mediocre) guitar, and am terrible at anything else
            requiring manual dexterity.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            This site is currently still under construction as I'm redoing it to
            be a bit more human focused (as opposed to my more index optimized
            <a href="resume.html" class="green">resume</a>) and to create space
            for some blogging. If you have any feedback for me about the current
            state of things please visit my 
            <a href="contact.html" class="green">contact</a> page and let me know.
          </p>
          <p class="mono">
            Thank you for coming by to visit,
            <br />
            Mihai
