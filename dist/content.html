            Pair Programming is two people writing, debugging, or exploring
            code together. Sounds simple right? It is, but it's also hard.
            Pairing is a skill like any other and it takes some practice to
            get good at it. Usually though, devs are either dropped or drop
            themselves straight into pairing with no guidelines to help with
            learning or resolving issues.

            Ahh MVC! The starting point of most web apps. But where do you go
            when it fails you? More importantly, how do you make your current
            living system grow into a new shape without stopping feature work?
            We'll explore some common MVC issues, what a Functional Hexagon
            is, and how to grow your MVC into a new, more hexagonal, shape
            without a big rewrite in the sky.

            Pair programming is a complex practice requiring skill to master.
            There are many resources on pair programming, but sometimes
            engineers are dropped into a pairing session with little
            preparation and expected to just figure it out. In this blog I
            hope to help other teams share in the benefits I've seen from pair
            programming and accelerate the spread of pair programming
            knowledge in the industry.
