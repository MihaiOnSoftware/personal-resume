# Purpose

This is my personal resume. One of the requirements I had for it when I sat down to originally create it was that there would be one downloadable file that could be emailed without triggering spam or other protections. Additionally I wanted it to be openable without an internet connection. In short I wanted it to be a replacement for a `.doc` file. As such I wrote it with no `Javascript` and no external dependencies. The only things I could use were `HTML` and `CSS`. The `CSS` had to live in the `HTML` file directly so that's why it's not split off.

# Future

My future plans for it include using [html-inline](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-inline) to "compile" this file so that I can split off the `CSS`. Maybe I'll find a nice way to split the actual `HTML` too although I'm not sure how to do that in a stack agnostic way. At that point I plan to make a different version using some `Javascript` that's fancier for serving through my website [mpopescu.com](http://mpopescu.com/).
